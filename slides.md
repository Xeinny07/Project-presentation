## 2. The Problem

Many Nigerian secondary school students struggle with inconsistent access to quality academic support due to several challenges:

* Limited teacher availabilty and varying levels of expertise.
* Uneven access to learning materials and resources.
* Inadequate preparation for key exams like WAEC, NECO, and JAMB.
* Few opportunities for personalized learning or peer collaboration.
* Lack of academic support outside regular school hours.

These gaps lead to inconsistent performance, exam stress, and untapped potential.
