## 2. The Problem

Millions of students from underserved communities:

* Lack access to quality education due to poverty, location, or instability.
* Face digital exclusion, with little or no access to devices or internet.
* Are isolated from mentorship, encourage, and career guidance.
* Often drop out due to a lack of support systems and learning spaces.

>"A child's zip code should not determine their learning potential."
